# TriviaGame

This is a basic Marvel-themed Trivia game that utilizes JavaScript timers

The game can be played [here](https://siraj-mohammed.github.io/TriviaGame/)

The player is presented with two modes to choose from - Easy and Geek.
Geek mode questions are slightly more difficult than those in Easy mode.
There are a total of 7 questions in each mode.

The player has 20 seconds to answer each question. When the timer runs out, if the question is left unanswered, the correct answer is displayed, and the game advances to the next question. When all 7 questions have been attempted, the game ends and the statistics are displayed.
