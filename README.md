# TriviaGame

This is a basic Marvel-themed Trivia game that utilizes JavaScript timers

The game can be played [here](https://siraj-mohammed.github.io/TriviaGame/)

When the game starts, the player is presented with two modes to choose from - Easy and Geek. Each mode has 7 questions.
Questions in Geek mode are slightly more difficult than those in Easy mode. 

The player has 20 seconds to answer each question. When the player selects an answer, a response is provided showing whether the answer choice was correct or not. If the timer runs out and the question is left unanswered, the correct answer is displayed, and the game advances to the next question. When all 7 questions have been attempted, the game ends and the statistics are displayed showing the number of correct, incorrect and unanswered questions.
